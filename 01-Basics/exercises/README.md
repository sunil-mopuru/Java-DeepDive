2. Explicit type conversions (casting)
3. Shows potential data loss during casting
4. Converts between different numeric types

**Requirements:**
- Start with a double value: 123.789
- Convert to int, float, long, short, byte
- Display original and converted values

## Exercise 4: Operator Precedence Challenge
**Difficulty: Intermediate**

Predict the output of these expressions WITHOUT running the code:
```java
int a = 5, b = 10, c = 15;
```

1. `a + b * c`
2. `(a + b) * c`
3. `a + b * c / 3`
4. `a++ + ++b - c--`
5. `a < b && b < c || a > c`
6. `!false || true && false`

Then write a program to verify your answers and explain why each result occurs.

**Learning Goals:** Operator precedence, logical thinking, debugging skills

## Exercise 5: Temperature Converter
**Difficulty: Intermediate**

Create a comprehensive temperature converter that:
1. Converts between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin
2. Takes input for temperature and source unit
3. Displays conversions to all other units
4. Validates that Kelvin is not below absolute zero (-273.15¬∞C)

**Formulas:**
- Celsius to Fahrenheit: F = (C √ó 9/5) + 32
- Celsius to Kelvin: K = C + 273.15
- Fahrenheit to Celsius: C = (F - 32) √ó 5/9

**Sample Run:**
```
Enter temperature: 25
Enter unit (C/F/K): C
25.0¬∞C = 77.0¬∞F = 298.15K
```

**Learning Goals:** Mathematical operations, input validation, formatting

## Exercise 6: Grade Calculator
**Difficulty: Intermediate**

Write a program that:
1. Takes student scores for 5 subjects
2. Calculates average, highest, and lowest scores
3. Determines letter grade based on average
4. Uses appropriate data types for all calculations

**Grading Scale:**
- A: 90-100
- B: 80-89
- C: 70-79
- D: 60-69
- F: Below 60

**Learning Goals:** Arrays (basic), mathematical operations, conditional logic

## Exercise 7: Bitwise Operations Explorer
**Difficulty: Advanced**

Create a program that:
1. Takes two integers as input
2. Displays their binary representations
3. Shows results of all bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
4. Demonstrates left and right shift operations
5. Explains what each operation does in practical terms

**Sample Output:**
```
Enter first number: 12
Enter second number: 7

12 in binary: 1100
7 in binary:  0111

12 & 7 = 4   (0100) - Bits set in both numbers
12 | 7 = 15  (1111) - Bits set in either number
12 ^ 7 = 11  (1011) - Bits set in one number only
~12 = -13    - All bits flipped

12 << 2 = 48  (110000) - Multiply by 4
12 >> 2 = 3   (0011)   - Divide by 4
```

**Learning Goals:** Bitwise operations, binary representation, advanced operators
