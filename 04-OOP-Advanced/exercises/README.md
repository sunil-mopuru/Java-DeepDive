## Exercise 1: Shape Hierarchy System
**Difficulty: Beginner**

Create an abstract `Shape` class with concrete implementations:
- Abstract methods: `calculateArea()`, `calculatePerimeter()`
- Concrete subclasses: `Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Triangle`
- Demonstrate polymorphism with shape array
- Override `toString()` and `equals()`
