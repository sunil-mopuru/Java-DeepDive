## Exercise 1: Grade Calculator Enhanced
**Difficulty: Beginner**

Create a program that:
1. Takes numeric scores for 5 subjects
2. Calculates average, highest, and lowest
3. Assigns letter grades based on average
4. Provides specific feedback for each grade range

**Requirements:**
- Use if-else-if for grade assignment
- Include input validation
- Handle edge cases (scores 0-100)

## Exercise 2: Interactive Menu System
**Difficulty: Beginner-Intermediate**

Build a calculator with menu:
1. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
2. Use switch statement for operations
3. Continue until user chooses exit
4. Handle division by zero

**Learning Goals:** Switch statements, do-while loops, input validation

## Exercise 4: Prime Number Finder
**Difficulty: Intermediate**

Write a program that:
1. Finds all prime numbers between 1-100
2. Uses efficient algorithm (check up to ‚àön)
3. Counts and displays total primes found
4. Shows execution time

**Learning Goals:** Nested loops, break statements, algorithm optimization

## Exercise 5: Number Guessing Game
**Difficulty: Intermediate**

Implement complete guessing game:
1. Computer generates random number (1-100)
2. User has 7 attempts to guess
3. Provide "higher/lower" hints
4. Track statistics (games played, won, best score)

**Features:**
- Input validation
- Difficulty levels (different ranges)
- Play again option

## Exercise 6: Student Record System
**Difficulty: Advanced**

Create a system that:
1. Manages multiple students
2. Each student has: name, ID, grades array
3. Calculates GPA for each student
4. Finds class statistics (average, top performer)

**Menu Options:**
- Add student
- Enter grades
- View student report
- Class summary
- Exit

## Exercise 7: ASCII Art Generator
**Difficulty: Advanced**

Build a program that generates:
1. Digital clock display (7-segment style)
2. Calendar for any month/year
3. Bar charts from data arrays
4. Text-based graphics

**Learning Goals:** Complex nested loops, pattern recognition

## Exercise 8: Loan Calculator
**Difficulty: Advanced**

Create comprehensive loan calculator:
1. Calculate monthly payments
2. Generate amortization schedule
3. Compare different loan terms
4. Handle early payments

**Formulas:**
- Monthly payment: M = P[r(1+r)^n]/[(1+r)^n-1]
- Where P=principal, r=monthly rate, n=number of payments
