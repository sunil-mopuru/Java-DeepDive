# Startup & Scale-up Interview Preparation

## ðŸš€ **Startup Environment Characteristics**

### **Key Differences from Enterprise**:
Startups and scale-ups operate in a fundamentally different environment:
- **Speed over Perfection**: Move fast, iterate quickly
- **Resource Constraints**: Do more with less, wear multiple hats
- **Uncertainty and Change**: Requirements change frequently
- **Flat Hierarchy**: Direct communication with founders/leadership
- **High Impact**: Individual contributions have significant visibility

### **Interview Focus Areas**:
