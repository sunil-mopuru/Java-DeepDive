**Situation**: Need to explain microservices architecture to non-technical stakeholders.

**Communication Strategy**:
```java
// Framework for explaining technical concepts to different audiences
@Component
public class TechnicalCommunicationFramework {
    
    public void explainToStakeholders(TechnicalConcept concept, Audience audience) {
        // 1. Understand your audience
        AudienceProfile profile = analyzeAudience(audience);
        
        // 2. Adapt language and examples
        CommunicationStyle style = adaptCommunicationStyle(profile);
        
        // 3. Structure explanation logically
        ExplanationStructure structure = createExplanationStructure(concept, profile);
        
        // 4. Use appropriate analogies and metaphors
        List<Analogy> analogies = selectAnalogies(concept, profile);
        
        // 5. Provide concrete examples
        List<Example> examples = createExamples(concept, profile);

        List<FAQ> faqs = prepareFAQs(concept, profile);
        
        // 7. Deliver with engagement
        deliverExplanation(structure, analogies, examples, faqs);

        /*
         * Executive-Friendly Explanation of Microservices
         * 
         * Analogy: Think of microservices like a restaurant kitchen
         * 
         * Traditional Monolith = One large kitchen where everything is prepared in one place
         * - All dishes (features) are made by the same team
         * - If one station breaks down, the whole kitchen slows down
         * - Hard to scale specific areas of demand
         * 
         * Microservices = Specialized stations in the kitchen
         * - Each station (service) focuses on one type of dish (business function)
         * - Stations can be scaled independently based on demand
         * - If one station has issues, others continue operating
         * - Different teams can specialize in different stations
         * 
         * Business Benefits:
         * 1. Faster Time-to-Market: Teams can work independently on different services
         * 2. Improved Reliability: Issues in one service don't crash the entire system
         * 3. Better Scalability: Scale high-demand services without over-provisioning
         * 4. Technology Flexibility: Use best tools for each specific service
         * 5. Organizational Alignment: Teams align with business capabilities
         * 
         * Key Metrics to Track:
         * - Deployment Frequency: How often we can release new features
         * - Mean Time to Recovery: How quickly we fix issues
         * - Change Failure Rate: Percentage of deployments that cause problems
         * - Service Availability: Uptime of critical business functions
         */

         * Product Manager-Friendly Explanation of Microservices
         * 
         * What Are Microservices?
         * - Independent services that work together to deliver your product features
         * - Each service owns a specific business capability (e.g., User Management, Payment Processing)
         * - Services communicate through well-defined APIs
         * 
         * Impact on Product Development:
         * 
         * Faster Feature Delivery:
         * - Teams can work on different services simultaneously
         * - No need to coordinate complex, system-wide releases
         * - A/B testing individual services is easier
         * 
         * Improved User Experience:
         * - Better performance through specialized optimization
         * - Higher availability - issues in one area don't affect others
         * - Faster bug fixes and updates
         * 
         * Considerations for Product Planning:
         * 
         * Dependencies:
         * - Some features may require coordination between services
         * - API contracts need to be maintained for compatibility
         * - Data consistency across services requires careful design
         * 
         * Release Management:
         * - Can release services independently
         * - Versioning strategy is important for backward compatibility
         * - Rollback procedures for individual services
         * 
         * Monitoring and Analytics:
         * - Need distributed tracing to understand user journeys
         * - Metrics per service for performance optimization
         * - Centralized logging for debugging

         * 
         * Architecture Patterns:

         * Service Decomposition:
         * - Bounded Contexts from Domain-Driven Design
         * - Single Responsibility Principle at service level
         * - Database per Service pattern
         * 
         * Communication Patterns:

         * Synchronous Communication:
         * - REST APIs with JSON over HTTP
         * - gRPC for high-performance internal communication
         * - Circuit Breaker pattern for fault tolerance
         * 
         * Asynchronous Communication:
         * - Event-driven architecture with message brokers
         * - Publish-Subscribe pattern for loose coupling
         * - Event Sourcing for audit trails
         * 
         * Data Management:
         * 
         * Distributed Data:
         * - Each service owns its database
         * - Saga pattern for distributed transactions
         * - CQRS for read/write separation
         * 
         * Challenges and Solutions:
         * 
         * Service Discovery:
         * - Netflix Eureka, Consul, or Kubernetes Service Discovery
         * - Client-side vs Server-side load balancing
         * 
         * Configuration Management:
         * - Spring Cloud Config, Consul, or Kubernetes ConfigMaps
         * - Externalized configuration for different environments
         * 
         * Security:

         * - Centralized logging with ELK stack
         * - Metrics collection with Prometheus and Grafana
         * 
         * Testing Strategy:
         * - Unit tests for individual services
         * - Contract testing between services
         * - Integration tests for service interactions
         * - End-to-end testing for critical user journeys

         * - Evaluate trade-offs objectively
         * 
         * 4. Use Objective Criteria:
         * - Performance benchmarks
         * - Industry best practices
         * - User experience data
         * - Maintainability metrics
         * - Security requirements
         * 
         * 5. Communication Techniques:
         * - Active listening: "What I hear you saying is..."
         * - Reframing: "Instead of viewing this as X vs Y, let's consider..."
         * - Finding common ground: "We all agree that Z is important..."
         * - Data-driven discussion: "Let's look at the metrics..."
         * 
         * 6. Decision Making Process:
         * - When consensus isn't possible, who decides?
         * - What are the escalation paths?
         * - How to handle disagreement with final decision?
         * - Document the decision and rationale
         * 
         * 7. Follow-up and Learning:
         * - Check if the decision is working as expected
         * - Learn from the conflict resolution process
         * - Improve team dynamics for future discussions
