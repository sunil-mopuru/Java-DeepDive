        }
    }
    
    // Data synchronization during migration
    @EventListener
    public void handleLegacyOrderEvent(LegacyOrderEvent event) {
        // Ensure data consistency between old and new systems
        try {
            newOrderService.syncOrder(event.getOrder());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Compensating action
            compensationService.handleSyncFailure(event);
        }

            .build();
    }
    
    // Technical debt tracking
    @Component
    public class TechnicalDebtTracker {
        
        public void assessCodebase() {
            DebtAnalysis analysis = codeAnalyzer.analyze();
            
            // Categorize debt
            List<DebtItem> criticalDebt = analysis.getCriticalItems();
            List<DebtItem> highDebt = analysis.getHighPriorityItems();
            
            // Generate actionable reports
            DebtReport report = DebtReport.builder()
                .withEstimatedEffort(analysis.getTotalEffort())
                .withBusinessImpact(analysis.getBusinessRisk())

            jiraService.createTechnicalDebtEpic(report);
        }
    }
}
```

## üéØ **Problem Solving & Decision Making**

### **Question 3: Performance Crisis Resolution**
**Describe a time when you had to diagnose and resolve a critical performance issue in production.**

**Systematic Approach**:
```
1. Immediate Response (0-30 minutes)
   - Gather initial metrics
   - Implement circuit breakers if needed
   - Scale horizontally if possible
   - Communicate with stakeholders

2. Investigation (30 minutes - 2 hours)  
   - Analyze application metrics
   - Review recent deployments
   - Check database performance
   - Examine external dependencies

3. Root Cause Analysis (2-8 hours)
   - Deep dive into logs and traces
   - Reproduce in staging environment
   - Identify the exact bottleneck
   - Validate hypothesis with data

4. Resolution & Prevention (Ongoing)
   - Implement fix with proper testing
   - Add monitoring for early detection
   - Create runbooks for similar issues
   - Conduct post-mortem session
```

**Technical Investigation Process**:
```java
// Performance monitoring toolkit
@Component
public class PerformanceInvestigator {
    
    public PerformanceReport diagnose(String serviceId, Duration timeWindow) {
        // Collect all relevant metrics
        Map<String, Object> metrics = metricsCollector.collect(serviceId, timeWindow);
        
        // Application-level metrics
        ResponseTimeAnalysis responseTime = analyzeResponseTimes(metrics);
        ThroughputAnalysis throughput = analyzeThroughput(metrics);
        ErrorRateAnalysis errors = analyzeErrors(metrics);
        
        // Infrastructure metrics  
        CpuAnalysis cpu = analyzeCpuUsage(metrics);
        MemoryAnalysis memory = analyzeMemoryUsage(metrics);
        
        // Database performance
        DatabaseAnalysis database = analyzeDatabasePerformance(serviceId, timeWindow);
        
        // Generate recommendations
        List<Recommendation> recommendations = generateRecommendations(
            responseTime, throughput, errors, cpu, memory, database);
            
        return new PerformanceReport(recommendations, metrics);
    }
    
    private List<Recommendation> generateRecommendations(
            ResponseTimeAnalysis responseTime,
            ThroughputAnalysis throughput,
            ErrorRateAnalysis errors,
            CpuAnalysis cpu,
            MemoryAnalysis memory,
            DatabaseAnalysis database) {
        
        List<Recommendation> recommendations = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // High response time + high CPU = compute bottleneck
        if (responseTime.isHigh() && cpu.isHigh()) {
            recommendations.add(new Recommendation(
                "Scale horizontally or optimize CPU-intensive code",
                Priority.HIGH,
                "CPU bottleneck detected"
            ));
        }
        
        // High response time + high database latency = database bottleneck
        if (responseTime.isHigh() && database.hasHighLatency()) {
            recommendations.add(new Recommendation(
                "Optimize database queries or add read replicas",
                Priority.HIGH,
                "Database bottleneck detected"
            ));
        }
        
        // Memory pressure indicators
        if (memory.hasHighUsage() && errors.hasOutOfMemoryErrors()) {
            recommendations.add(new Recommendation(
                "Investigate memory leaks or increase heap size",
                Priority.CRITICAL,
                "Memory pressure causing errors"
            ));
        }
        
        return recommendations;
    }
}
```

### **Question 4: Architectural Decision Making**
**Walk me through how you evaluate and choose between different architectural approaches.**

**Decision Framework**:
```
1. Requirements Analysis
   - Functional requirements
   - Non-functional requirements (performance, scalability, security)
   - Constraints (timeline, budget, team expertise)

2. Options Evaluation
   - Identify 2-3 viable approaches
   - Create proof of concepts if needed
   - Analyze trade-offs systematically

3. Decision Matrix
   - Weight criteria by importance
   - Score each option objectively
   - Consider long-term implications

4. Documentation & Communication
   - Create Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
   - Present to stakeholders
   - Get consensus from team
```

**ADR Template Example**:
```markdown

```

## ü§ù **Team Management & Mentoring**

### **Question 5: Growing Junior Developers**
**How do you approach mentoring junior developers and helping them grow?**

**Structured Mentoring Approach**:
```java
// Mentoring framework implementation
@Component
public class DeveloperMentorship {
    
    public MentorshipPlan createPlan(Developer mentee) {
        // Assess current skill level
        SkillAssessment assessment = assessSkills(mentee);
        
        // Identify growth areas
        List<SkillGap> gaps = identifySkillGaps(assessment, mentee.getCareerGoals());
        
        // Create learning path
        LearningPath learningPath = LearningPath.builder()
            .withTimeframe(Duration.ofMonths(6))
            .withWeeklyGoals(gaps.stream()
                .map(this::createWeeklyGoals)
                .collect(Collectors.toList()))
            .withProjects(selectMentorshipProjects(gaps))
            .withCheckpoints(createProgressCheckpoints())
            .build();
            
        return new MentorshipPlan(mentee, learningPath);
    }
    
    // Progressive task assignment
    public Task assignNextTask(Developer mentee, SkillLevel currentLevel) {
        return switch(currentLevel) {
            case JUNIOR -> createStructuredTask(mentee);      // Clear requirements
            case INTERMEDIATE -> createGuidedTask(mentee);    // General direction
            case SENIOR -> createOpenEndedTask(mentee);       // Problem statement only
        };
    }
    
    // Code review as teaching tool
    public ReviewFeedback conductMentoringReview(PullRequest pr, Developer author) {
        return ReviewFeedback.builder()
            .withEducationalComments(generateLearningComments(pr))
            .withBestPracticeExamples(findBestPracticeOpportunities(pr))
            .withResourceRecommendations(recommendLearningResources(pr))
            .withPairProgrammingSession(scheduleIfNeeded(pr.getComplexity()))
            .build();
    }
}
```

**Mentoring Strategies**:
1. **Gradual Complexity Increase**: Start with well-defined tasks, gradually increase ambiguity
2. **Code Review as Teaching**: Use reviews to explain best practices and design principles
3. **Pair Programming**: Work together on complex problems to demonstrate thinking process
4. **Project Ownership**: Give ownership of smaller features to build confidence
5. **Regular 1:1s**: Discuss career goals, challenges, and provide feedback

### **Question 6: Managing Technical Disagreements**
**How do you handle situations where team members have strong disagreements about technical approaches?**

**Conflict Resolution Process**:
```
1. Facilitate Open Discussion
   - Create safe space for all viewpoints
   - Focus on technical merits, not personalities
   - Use data and evidence when possible

2. Structured Evaluation
   - Define evaluation criteria upfront
   - Time-box the discussion
   - Document all approaches considered

3. Decision Making
   - Use consensus when possible
   - Make final decision if consensus not reached
   - Explain reasoning clearly to all parties

4. Follow-up
   - Monitor results of chosen approach
   - Be willing to course-correct if needed
   - Learn from the experience
```

**Innovation Strategy**:
```java
// Innovation time allocation
@Component
public class InnovationManager {
    
    // 20% time for innovation and learning
    public void allocateInnovationTime() {
        TeamCapacity capacity = calculateTeamCapacity();
        
        InnovationBudget budget = InnovationBudget.builder()
            .withExperimentationTime(capacity.multiply(0.15))  // 15% for experiments
            .withLearningTime(capacity.multiply(0.05))         // 5% for learning
            .withTechDebtTime(capacity.multiply(0.10))         // 10% for tech debt
            .withDeliveryTime(capacity.multiply(0.70))         // 70% for delivery
            .build();
            
        // Track innovation outcomes
        trackInnovationMetrics(budget);
    }
    
    // Innovation pipeline
    public void manageInnovationPipeline() {
        List<Innovation> ideas = collectInnovationIdeas();
        
        // Prioritize based on impact and feasibility
        List<Innovation> prioritized = ideas.stream()
            .sorted(Comparator.comparing(Innovation::getBusinessValue)
                      .thenComparing(Innovation::getFeasibility))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
